# Session Summary

This session focused on addressing issues related to session status synchronization and improving the maintainability of the frontend JavaScript code.

## 1. Fixing `scan_and_build_status` in `app/jobs.py`

**Problem:**
The `scan_and_build_status` function in `app/jobs.py` was failing to correctly identify extracted page images and OCR results, particularly in local development environments. This was due to an overly complex file path matching logic that didn't correctly account for how `StorageService.list_files` returned paths, especially when subdirectories like `pages/` or `results/` were involved. The function was attempting to parse full paths from the `list_files` output, which was inconsistent between local and cloud storage.

**Solution:**
The `scan_and_build_status` function was refactored to leverage the `prefix` argument of the `StorageService.list_files` method. This simplifies the logic by explicitly requesting files within the `pages` and `results` subdirectories. This approach works transparently for both local filesystem and Google Cloud Storage, as the `StorageService` handles the underlying path resolution.

**Changes Made:**
*   Modified `app/jobs.py`:
    *   The logic for counting `pages_extracted` was updated to call `self.storage_service.list_files(prefix="pages", session_hash=session_id)`.
    *   The logic for counting `ocr_completed` was updated to call `self.storage_service.list_files(prefix="results", session_hash=session_id)`.

## 2. Ensuring Session Status Synchronization on Page Load

**Problem:**
Upon page load, the frontend was relying on potentially stale `session_status.json` files for existing sessions, leading to an inaccurate representation of job progress in the UI. The goal was to force a server-side rebuild of the session status to ensure the UI always reflects the true state.

**Solution:**
The frontend JavaScript was modified to trigger a server-side rebuild of the session status for each existing session immediately upon page load. This utilizes the `POST /api/jobs/{session_id}/rebuild-status` endpoint.

**Changes Made:**
*   Modified `app/static/js/app.js` (before refactoring into modules):
    *   The `refreshAllSessionStatus` function in the `SessionManager` class was updated.
    *   Instead of first attempting to fetch `session_status.json` and then conditionally rebuilding, it now *always* calls the `rebuildSessionStatus` API endpoint for each session.
    *   This ensures that the server rescans the actual files in storage and updates the `session_status.json` before the frontend processes it.

## 3. Refactoring `app.js` into Modular Components

**Problem:**
The original `app.js` file had grown significantly, becoming a monolithic script that was difficult to maintain, understand, and extend. It contained logic for UI management, file uploading, API communication, and utility functions, all intertwined.

**Solution:**
The large `app.js` file was refactored into several smaller, more focused JavaScript modules using ES module syntax (`import`/`export`). This improves code organization, readability, and maintainability. All new files were placed directly in the `app/static/js/` directory as per user instruction.

**New Files Created in `app/static/js/`:**
*   `ModalManager.js`: Encapsulates all logic related to displaying and managing modal dialogs (e.g., progress, confirmation, alerts).
*   `utils.js`: Contains general utility functions such as `getUserEmail`, `computeUserHash`, `formatFileSize`, and `escapeHtml`.
*   `api.js`: Centralizes all API calls to the backend, including `rebuildSessionStatus` and `createJob`.
*   `SessionManager.js`: Manages the application's session state, including loading/saving sessions, updating session data, and refreshing UI based on session status. It imports `ModalManager`, `api`, and `utils`.
*   `FileUploader.js`: Handles all file upload mechanisms, including normal and chunked uploads, and interacts with the `SessionManager` and `ModalManager`.
*   `main.js`: The new entry point for the application. It initializes the `SessionManager` and `FileUploader` instances and sets up global event listeners and functions.

**Changes to `app/templates/index.html`:**
*   The `<script>` tag referencing `app.js` was replaced with a `<script type="module" src="/static/js/main.js"></script>` to load the new modular entry point.

**Note:** The original `app.js` file was not deleted as per user instruction.
