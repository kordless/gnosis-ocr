# GCS Status Endpoint Fix Summary

## The Root Issue
The status endpoint was failing with `session_hash: null` because:
1. The storage service was being forced into GCS mode improperly
2. Local storage paths were conflicting with GCS operations
3. The error response didn't include the session_hash from the URL

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Proper Cloud Mode Switching
Added `force_cloud_mode()` method to StorageService that:
- Properly clears local storage attributes
- Reinitializes GCS client
- Updates cache paths for cloud environment

### 2. Enhanced GCS Consistency Handling
- Added verification after writing critical files (metadata.json, status.json)
- Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff in `validate_session()`
- Added detailed logging for GCS operations

### 3. Better Error Response
- Exception handler now extracts session_hash from URL path
- Supports all endpoint patterns including debug endpoints
- Returns session_hash in error responses for better debugging

### 4. Improved Logging
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the request flow
- Logs user hash, cloud mode, and session validation results
- Helps track GCS consistency issues

## Testing the Fix

1. **Deploy the updated code** to Cloud Run
2. **Monitor logs** for these key messages:
   - "Forcing cloud mode for storage service"
   - "GCS initialization completed"
   - "Session validation" with retry attempts
   
3. **Use the debug endpoint** to inspect session state:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-service.run.app/api/debug/session/{session_hash}
   ```

4. **Check for GCS consistency**:
   - Look for "GCS file verified" messages
   - Watch for retry attempts in validation

## Key Code Changes

### storage_service_v2.py
- Added `force_cloud_mode()` method
- Enhanced GCS file verification
- Improved retry logic with logging

### main_v2.py
- Use `force_cloud_mode()` instead of manual attribute setting
- Enhanced exception handler with session_hash extraction
- Added comprehensive logging in status endpoint

## Expected Behavior
1. Sessions created in upload endpoint persist to GCS
2. Status endpoint finds sessions with retry logic for eventual consistency
3. Error responses include session_hash for debugging
4. Comprehensive logs show the full request flow

## If Issues Persist
1. Check GCS bucket permissions
2. Verify GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS is set correctly
3. Look for "GCS consistency issue" warnings in logs
4. Use debug endpoint to inspect session files directly
5. Consider increasing retry count or delays for high-latency scenarios
