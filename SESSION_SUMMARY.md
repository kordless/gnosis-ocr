# Session Summary - Chunked Upload Race Condition Fix

## Date: 2025-07-13

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Chunked Upload Race Condition
**Problem:** Large files (3MB+) were failing with "Missing chunk 1" errors due to chunks arriving out of order.

**Root Cause:** Frontend JavaScript was sending chunks asynchronously, causing chunk 3 to arrive before chunk 1.

**Solution:** Enhanced backend chunk processing logic in `app/main.py`:
- More robust header extraction for chunk numbers (both `request.headers` and `file.headers`)
- Better duplicate chunk handling
- Improved error reporting showing which chunks are missing vs received
- Added detailed logging for debugging

### 2. PDF Processing Blocking Upload Response
**Problem:** Large PDFs (458 pages) were blocking the HTTP response during upload because PDF-to-image extraction was happening synchronously.

**Root Cause:** `pdf2image.convert_from_bytes()` was running in the upload endpoint, taking minutes for large documents.

**Solution:** Moved PDF extraction to background processing:
- **Local mode:** Extract images in OCR service background thread
- **Cloud mode:** Extract images in Cloud Tasks worker
- Upload endpoint now saves raw PDF and returns immediately
- Added progress updates during extraction (every 10 pages)

### 3. Aggressive Polling
**Problem:** Frontend was polling job status every 1 second, which is excessive for long-running jobs.

**Solution:** Changed polling interval to 5 seconds in `app/static/script.js`

## Files Modified

### `app/main.py`
- Enhanced `upload_job_chunk()` function with better header parsing and error handling
- Removed synchronous PDF extraction from upload endpoint
- Modified `create_cloud_processing_job()` to handle raw files
- Updated dual-path logic for cloud vs local processing

### `app/ocr_service.py`
- Added `_extract_images_from_raw_file()` method for background PDF processing
- Enhanced job processing to handle raw files vs pre-extracted images
- Added status updates during PDF extraction process
- Improved progress reporting with GCS status updates

### `app/static/script.js`
- Changed polling intervals from 1000ms to 5000ms (5 seconds)
- Updated both `startStatusChecking()` and `startJobStatusChecking()`

## Architecture Improvements

### Dual-Path Processing
The system now properly handles both environments:

**Local Development:**
1. Upload chunks â†’ Save raw PDF â†’ Submit to OCR service
2. OCR service extracts PDF images in ThreadPoolExecutor
3. Process pages with progress updates

**Cloud Run:**
1. Upload chunks â†’ Save raw PDF â†’ Create processing.json
2. Cloud Tasks worker extracts PDF images
3. Cloud Tasks processes pages in batches

### Performance Benefits
- **Upload Response Time:** Immediate return after file save (vs minutes for large PDFs)
- **Thread Safety:** No more blocking HTTP threads during PDF processing
- **Resource Efficiency:** Reduced polling frequency from 1/sec to 1/5sec
- **Better UX:** Progress updates during extraction phase

## Testing Status
- âœ… Chunked upload race condition fixed (all 4 chunks received correctly)
- âœ… PDF processing moved to background (upload returns immediately)
- âœ… Polling frequency reduced (5-second intervals)
- ðŸ”„ Large document (458 pages) processing - in progress

## Next Steps
1. Test with restarted system and fixed Docker MCP tools
2. Verify progress updates work correctly during PDF extraction
3. Confirm Cloud Tasks worker handles raw files properly
4. Monitor performance with large documents

## Environment Variables
- `RUNNING_IN_CLOUD=true` - Enables Cloud Tasks path
- `OCR_BATCH_SIZE=10` - Cloud Tasks batch size
- Standard GCS and Cloud Tasks configuration

## Technical Notes
- Chunk numbering: 0-indexed (0 to totalChunks-1)
- PDF extraction progress: 10% â†’ 20% â†’ 30-50% (incremental)
- Status updates: Every 10 pages to avoid excessive writes
- Error handling: Detailed logging and missing chunk reporting
